Chennai is the capital of the state Tamil Nadu in India and it is the fourth most populous urban agglomeration in India. 
During the Chennai floods of December 2015, the city in Tamil Nadu experienced rainfall that broke records of about hundred years. Therefore it is very much requqired that the city revamps its water management system.
In the past four decades urbanisation increased almost four times at the cost of green and open area. A better understanding of aquatic ecosystem is needed to enable development of best management practices, thus transforming the way the land and water are being used.
